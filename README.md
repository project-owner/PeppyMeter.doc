PeppyMeter is a software VU Meter written in Python. It was originally developped as the new 'VU Meter' screensaver for [Peppy Player](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki). With minor modifications it became a stand-alone application.
PeppyMeter gets audio data from media players (e.g. mpd) via fifo and displays current volume level in a Graphical User Interface
 in a form of traditional VU Meter.
